# Content Templates for Telligent Community

This is still currently a Work in Progress, building a plugin that allows community admins to configure a template (or set of templates) that users can then insert into there content using the rich text area.

This plugin is part of a [video training series](https://www.ardourdigital.co.uk/training), showing how to build a Telligent plugin.
